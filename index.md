# Jose David GÃ³mez Ruiz
## Junior Geologist for GeoPark
### Since 2024
I am a highly motivated geologist with a passion for energy sustainability, including CCS and renewable energy sources (i.e., H2 and Geothermics). My expertise spans stratigraphy, petroleum geology, and harnessing data science in geosciences. I'm dedicated to solving complex challenges by integrating geological data to create models through tools like IHS Kingdom, Petrel E&P, OpendTect, QGIS, and Python among others. I enjoy fieldwork, programming, and learning about recent technology and knowledge developments. Last but not least, I've been a speaker at technical events, actively contributing to student chapters, and permanently diving into research.
